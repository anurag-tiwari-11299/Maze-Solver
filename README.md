# Maze-Solver
<br>
<h2>Descriptions</h2><br>
<ul><li>A maze called as 2D grid, have shortest possible path from starting point to ending point.</li>
<li>Here we perform DFS algo here to traverse on 2D array to find the path with the use of Java language.</li></ul>
<h2>Features</h2><br>
<ul><li>Grids - have different colors according to obstacles, boundary, path and free blocks.</li>
<li>Path - from starting to ending point.</li>
<li>Algo - Business logic to finding the path i.e., DFS</li>
<li>GUI - make interaction between user & system.</li></ul>
<h2>Technologies</h2><br>
<ul><li>Java - used for traversal of grid with DFS</li>
<li>GUI - use JavaSwing component i.e., JFrame</li></ul>
