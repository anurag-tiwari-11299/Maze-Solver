<h2>Descriptions</h2>
<br>

<li>A maze called as 2D grid, have shortest possible path from starting point to ending point.</li>
<li>Here we perform DFS algo here to traverse on 2D array to find the path with the use of Java language.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Grids :- have different colors according to obstacles, boundary, path and free blocks.</li>
<li>Path :- from starting to ending point.</li>
<li>Algo :- Business logic to finding the path i.e., DFS</li>
<li>GUI :- make interaction between user & system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technologies</h2>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Java :- used for traversal of grid with DFS</li>
<li>GUI :- use JavaSwing component i.e., JFrame</li>
